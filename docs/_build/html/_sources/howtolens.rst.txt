HowToLens Lectures
------------------

The best way to learn **PyAutoLens** is by going through the **HowToLens** lecture series on the `autolens workspace <https://github.com/Jammy2211/autolens_workspace>`_.

The lectures are provided as Jupyter notebooks - checkout
`this link <https://github.com/Jammy2211/autolens_workspace/blob/master/howtolens/chapter_1_introduction/tutorial_2_profiles.ipynb>`_
for an example of one of the first notebooks.

It can be found in the workspace & consists of 5 chapters:

- **Introduction** - An introduction to strong gravitational lensing & **PyAutolens**.
- **Lens Modeling** - How to model strong lenses, including a primer on Bayesian non-linear analysis.
- **Pipelines** - How to build pipelines & tailor them to your own science case.
- **Inversions** - How to perform pixelized reconstructions of the source-galaxy.
- **Hyper-Mode** - How to use **PyAutoLens** advanced modeling features that adapt the model to the strong lens being analysed.
