When two galaxies are aligned perfectly down the line-of-sight to Earth, the background galaxy's light is bent by the
intervening mass of the foreground galaxy. Its light can be fully bent around the foreground galaxy, traversing multiple
paths to the Earth, meaning that the background galaxy is observed multiple times. This by-chance alignment of two
galaxies is called a strong gravitational lens and a two-dimensional scheme of such a system is pictured below.

PyAutoLens is software designed for modeling these strong lensing systems! To begin, lets import autolens and the plot
module.

.. code-block:: bash

   import autolens as al
   import autolens.plot as aplt

To describe the deflection of light, **PyAutoLens** uses *grid* data structures, which are two-dimensional
Cartesian grids of (y,x) coordinates. Below, we make and plot a uniform Cartesian grid:

.. code-block:: bash

    grid = al.Grid.uniform(
        shape_2d=(50, 50), pixel_scales=0.05 # <- The pixel-scale describes the conversion from pixel units to arc-seconds.
    )

    aplt.Grid(grid=grid)

This is what our grid looks like:

  :width: 400
  :alt: Alternative text

Our aim is to ray-trace this grid's coordinates to calculate how the lens galaxy's mass deflects the source galaxy's
light. We therefore need analytic functions representing light and mass distributions. For this, **PyAutoLens** uses
*Profile* objects and below we use the elliptical Sersic *LightProfile* object to represent a light distribution:

.. code-block:: bash

    sersic_light_profile = al.lp.EllipticalSersic(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0),
        axis_ratio=0.9,
        phi=60.0,
        intensity=0.05,
        effective_radius=2.0,
        sersic_index=4.0,
    )

By passing this profile a grid, we can evaluate the light at every coordinate on that grid and create an image
of the light profile:

.. code-block:: bash

    image = sersic_light_profile.profile_image_from_grid(grid=grid)

The plot module provides convinience methods for plotting properties of objects, like the image of a *LightProfile*:

.. code-block:: bash

    aplt.LightProfile(light_profile=sersic_light_profile)

Heres the image of the light profile:

  :width: 400
  :alt: Alternative text

**PyAutoLens** uses *MassProfile* objects to represent different mass distributions and use them to perform ray-tracing
calculations. Below we create an elliptical isothermal *MassProfile* and compute its convergence, gravitational
potential and deflection angles on our Cartesian grid:

.. code-block:: bash

    isothermal_mass_profile = al.mp.EllipticalIsothermal(
        centre=(0.0, 0.0),
        axis_ratio=0.8,
        phi=120.0,
        einstein_radius=1.6,
    )

    convergence = isothermal_mass_profile.convergence_from_grid(grid=grid)
    potential = isothermal_mass_profile.potential_from_grid(grid=grid)
    deflections = isothermal_mass_profile.deflections_from_grid(grid=grid)

    aplt.MassProfile.convergence(mass_profile=isothermal_mass_profile)
    aplt.MassProfile.potential(mass_profile=isothermal_mass_profile)
    aplt.MassProfile.deflections(mass_profile=isothermal_mass_profile)

Heres how the convergence, potential and deflection angles look:

For anyone not familiar with gravitational lensing, don't worry about what the convergence and potential are. The key
thing to note is that the deflection angles describe how a given mass distribution deflections light-rays, which allows
us create strong lens systems like the one shown above!

In **PyAutoLens**, a *Galaxy* object is a collection of *LightProfile* and *MassProfile* objects at a given redshift.
The code below creates two galaxies representing the lens and source galaxies shown in the strong lensing diagram above.

.. code-block:: bash

   lens_galaxy = al.Galaxy(
       redshift=0.5, light=sersic_light_profile, mass=isothermal_mass_profile
   )

   source_galaxy = al.Galaxy(redshift=1.0, light=another_light_profile)

The geometry of the strong lens system depends on the cosmological distances between the Earth, lens and source and
therefore the redshifts of the lens galaxy and source galaxy objects. By passing these *Galaxy* objects to the
*Tracer* class **PyAutoLens** uses these galaxy redshifts and a cosmological model to create the appropriate strong
lens system.

.. code-block:: bash

    tracer = al.Tracer.from_galaxies(
        galaxies=[lens_galaxy, source_galaxy], cosmology=cosmo.LambdaCDM
    )

    image = tracer.profile_image_from_grid(grid=grid)

    aplt.Tracer.profile_image(tracer=tracer, grid=grid)

When computing the image from the tracer above, the tracer performs all ray-tracing for the given strong lens system.
This includes using the lens galaxy's mass profile to deflect the light-rays that are traced to the source galaxy.
This makes the image below, where the source's light appears as a multiply imaged and strongly lensed Einstein ring.

The PyAutoLens API has been designed such that all of the objects introduced above are extensible. *Galaxy* objects can
take many profiles and *Tracer* objects many galaxies. If the galaxies are at different redshifts a strong lensing
system with multiple lens planes will be created, performing complex multi-plane ray-tracing calculations.

To finish, lets create a tracer using 3 galaxies at different redshifts. The mass distribution of the first lens
galaxy has separate components for its stellar mass and dark matter. This forms a system with two distinct Einstein
rings!

.. code-block:: bash

    lens_galaxy_0 = al.Galaxy(
        redshift=0.5,
        bulge=al.lmp.EllipticalSersic(
            centre=(0.0, 0.0),
            axis_ratio=0.9,
            phi=45.0,
            intensity=0.5,
            effective_radius=0.3,
            sersic_index=2.5,
            mass_to_light_ratio=0.3,
        ),
        disk=al.lmp.EllipticalExponential(
            centre=(0.0, 0.0),
            axis_ratio=0.6,
            phi=45.0,
            intensity=1.0,
            effective_radius=2.0,
            mass_to_light_ratio=0.2,
        ),
        dark=al.mp.SphericalNFW(centre=(0.0, 0.0), kappa_s=0.08, scale_radius=30.0),
    )

    lens_galaxy_1 = al.Galaxy(
        redshift=1.0,
        light=al.lp.EllipticalExponential(
            centre=(0.1, 0.1), axis_ratio=0.8, phi=60.0, intensity=3.0, effective_radius=0.1
        ),
        mass=al.mp.EllipticalIsothermal(
            centre=(0.1, 0.1), axis_ratio=0.8, phi=60.0, einstein_radius=0.4
        ),
    )

    source_galaxy = al.Galaxy(
        redshift=2.0,
        light=al.lp.EllipticalSersic(
            centre=(0.2, 0.2),
            axis_ratio=0.8,
            phi=60.0,
            intensity=2.0,
            effective_radius=0.1,
            sersic_index=1.5,
        ),
    )

    tracer = al.Tracer.from_galaxies(galaxies=[lens_galaxy_0, lens_galaxy_1, source_galaxy])

    aplt.Tracer.profile_image(tracer=tracer, grid=grid)

This is what the lens looks like:
